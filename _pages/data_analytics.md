Aside from research in political science, I am interested in conducting data analytics to find actionable business insights. This interest has recently led to me several opportunities to work as a data scientist at tech startups.

*Data Scientist, [Kiwi Insurance](https://www.kiwiinsure.co/)* (2020 Jun - 2020 Aug)
- Built webscrapers that can collect queried accounts on facebook and twitter. The application of this tool is wide - for instance, it can be also used to collect twitter & facebook accounts of assembly members. Please see an example of application to querying twitter accounts of South Korean assembly members [here](https://github.com/ehsong/twitter-scraper).
- Built a machine learning pipeline based on generalized linear models that improves prediction of insurance claims amount based on entity-level meta data, such as number of employees, zipcodes, and individual-level claims amount.

*Fellow, Insight Data Science* (San Francisco, 2020 Jan - 2020 May )

The Insight Data Science fellowship program is an intensive training fellowship to bridge the gap between academia and industry through project-based learning.

- Data consultant for [Elin.Ai](https://elin.ai/). Used unsupervised method of lexicon-based classification to classify mood from slack conversation data. My medium article on the project is [here](https://medium.com/@esther.e.song/mood-metric-detecting-mood-at-workplace-using-lexicon-based-approach-8a2b2bbba74).
