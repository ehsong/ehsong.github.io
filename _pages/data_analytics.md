Aside from research in political science, I am interested in conducting data analytics to find actionable business insights. I had several opportunities to work as a data scientist for tech startups.

*Data Scientist, [Kiwi Insurance](https://www.kiwiinsure.co/)* (2020 Jun - 2020 Aug)
- Built webscrapers that can collect meta data on queried accounts on facebook and twitter. Meta data includes the handle, name, number of followers, number following, etc. Please see an applied example of the webscraper querying twitter accounts of South Korean assembly members [here](https://github.com/ehsong/twitter-scraper).
- Built a machine learning pipeline based on generalized linear models that improves prediction of insurance claims amount based on 74K+ entity-level meta data, such as number of employees, zipcodes, and individual-level claims amount.

*Fellow, Insight Data Science* (San Francisco, 2020 Jan - 2020 May )

The [Insight Data Science](https://insightfellows.com/data-science) fellowship program is an intensive training fellowship to bridge the gap between academia and industry through project-based learning.

- Data consultant for [Elin.Ai](https://elin.ai/). Used unsupervised method of lexicon-based classification to classify mood from 30K+ slack conversation data. My medium article on the project is [here](https://medium.com/@esther.e.song/mood-metric-detecting-mood-at-workplace-using-lexicon-based-approach-8a2b2bbba74).
