I was born in South Korea and spent my childhood and adolescence in both South Korea and the U.S. My exposure to two distinct cultures at a young age had a great impact on forming my passion and interest in learning and exploring different societies and cultures. During college years, I lived in London, UK where I studied as an exchange student at the [School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)](https://www.soas.ac.uk/). 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors by hiking.
