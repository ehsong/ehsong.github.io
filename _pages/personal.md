I was born in South Korea and spent my childhood and adolescence in both South Korea and the U.S. My exposure to two distinct cultures at a young age had a great impact on forming my passion and interest in learning and exploring different societies and cultures. Due to my studies, I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to live in different parts of the world - Seoul, London, Beijing, Shanghai, California, and Hamburg. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors.
