I was born in South Korea and spent my childhood and adolescence in both South Korea and the U.S. My exposure to two distinct cultures at a young age had a great impact on forming my adaptibility and interest in exploring different societies and cultures. My interest in China is largely formed by my experience growing up in South Korea - although the two countries are geographically and culturally close, why and how are they diffent political and economically? (I have a somewhat similar curiosity about Japan as well.) In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors.
