I was born in South Korea and spent my childhood and adolescence in both South Korea and the U.S. My exposure to two distinct cultures at a young age had a great impact on forming my passion and interest in learning and exploring different societies and cultures. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, hiking, and traveling.
