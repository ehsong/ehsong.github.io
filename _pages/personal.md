Before coming to Stanford, I received B.A. in Political Science and Economics (double degree) from Korea University in Seoul, South Korea. During my undergraduate years, I also finished a one-year exchange program at the Department of Politics & International Relations at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.

I was born in South Korea and grew up in between Busan, South Korea and Cambridge, Massachusetts.
