**NGOs, the State, and Services in Contemporary China**

Since 1978, there has been an increase in the number of non-governmental organizations in China. According to some sources, there are approximately 0.4 million registered NGOs [^1] and 3 million unregistered groups [^2]. This phenomenon itself is puzzling, given frequent western media reports on crackdowns on civil society groups in China.

My dissertation asks three interrelated questions regarding this phenomenon. First, why has the party-state allowed political space for NGOs? I argue that this phenomenon should be seen through different policy goals involving NGOs since the 1980s. Contrary to the western definition of voluntary associational groups, the origins of NGOs are wide, consisting of prior governmental agencies, civilian-established groups, and semi-civilian groups incubated by incubators run by government agencies. This landscape has emerged due to different policy goals of the party-state towards NGOs since the late 80s: during the 90s, NGOs were primarily viewed as vehicles to streamline the bureaucracy. During the mid-2000s, the party-state turned towards ideas akin to neoliberal public sector reforms focused on devolving welfare to the private and third sector, opening up the opportunity for third sector organizations. From post-2011 and onward, NGOs have become the focal point of grassroots governance – NGOs, now renamed to social service organizations, are assigned the task of coordinating grassroots demands and alleviating potential tensions. A review of the institutional environment for NGOs reflects both party-state focus on devolution, but also adaptiveness and corporatism.

Second, how were local governments able to implement downsizing in the early 2000s? NGOs during the late 90s to early 2000s were used as legal terminology to decrease the number of public employees dependent on state finances. Within the authoritarian political context, members of the bureaucracy are agents of the party-state, which is difficult for rulers to discharge. The subsequent transformation of the bureaucratic units to non-governmental bureaus involves transforming state agents to social agents deprived of state benefits. How was this possible, and what explains variation in success and failure?

Second, how is the party-state promoting the growth of service-oriented NGOs, and what are the consequences? The party-state's focus on the promotion of NGOs in the post-2011 period involves the effort to minimize possible contention that can arise from the grassroots level. Service-oriented organizations are viewed as tools to alleviate tensions. Do these services then change the beneficiaries' attitudes towards the state? If so, how?

Drawing from theories of public sector reform, authoritarian politics, and non-state service provision, my essays comprehensively demonstrate how an authoritarian state such as China can utilize non-governmental organizations to serve its interests. My research attempts to contribute to understanding the use of non-governmental organizations and civil society in governance in authoritarian states.
