**Political Economy of Public and Social Service Reforms in Reform China**

China is in the process of implementing market-oriented public and social service reforms, which has led to increased competitive and non-competitive contracting with non-state actors, such as non-governmental organizations and private companies. This dissertation asks two unanswered questions regarding the phenomenon: (1) first, how have local governments implemented such reforms to their public service infrastructure? Public and social service provision in China in the past has been largely based on within-bureaucracy contracting or provision through state-owned-enterprises which is not based on standards of economic efficiency. (2)  Second, how has the government instituted social service contracting, what types of services are being outsourced, and what are the consequences for the state and the citizens? I answer these questions with multi-method research design involving fieldwork, case studies using secondary sources, text analyses of government records, and quantitative analysis of official government data and a unique survey conducted in the field. My research attempts to contribute to understanding the causes and consequences of neoliberal public sector reforms in authoritarian political context.
