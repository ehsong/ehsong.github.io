**"NGOs, the State, and Services in Reform China"**

Since 1978, there has been an increase in number of non-governmental organizations in China. Besides the increase of grassroots activism due to recent efforts by the party-state to promote philanthropy, these organizations have increased largely due to the party-state's ideas to implement neoliberal public sector reforms which promotes contracting with non-state entities. The state-led initiatives unfolded in two separate periods: first, during the early 2000s when NGOs were used for downsizing the bureaucracy, and second, the post-2011 period when both state and civilian-based NGOs began to flourish due to the party-state's increasing need for grassroots service provision.

The empirical chapters of my dissertation asks two questions in regards to these state initiatives. First, how were the localities able to implement downsizing? Within authoritarian political context, members of the bureaucracy are agents of the party-state, which is difficult for rulers to discharge. The subsequent transformation of the bureaucratic units to non-governmental bureaus involve transforming state agents to social agents deprived of state benefits. 

Second, how is the party-state promoting the growth of service-oriented NGOs, and what are the consequences? The party-state's focus on the promotion of NGOs in the post-2011 period involve the effort to minimize possible contention that can rise from the grassroots level. Service-oriented organizations are viewed as tools to alleviate tensions. Do these services then change beneficiaries' attitudes towards the state? If so, how?

Drawing from theories of public sector reform, authoritarian politics, and non-state service provision, the two empirical pieces demonstrate how an authoritarian state such as China can utilize non-governmental organization to reach its goals. My research attempts to contribute to understanding the causes and consequences of neoliberal public sector reforms in authoritarian political context.
