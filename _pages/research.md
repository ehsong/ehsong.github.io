*Building Legitimacy from the Grassroots: Evidence from Social Service Organizations in Shanghai* (manuscript available upon request)

The Chinese Communist Party has recently acknowledged its attempts to bolster good governance   by outsourcing public and social service functions to social organizations – nonprofit organizations, either created by relevant government bureaus, developed through nonprofit incubators, or voluntarily created civil society groups. Do these services gender political trust for the party-state, and if so, why? Two findings stand out. (1) service efficacy – the internal belief that one can affect the content of the services show strong correlation with political trust and the relationship is stronger than that between service quality and political support. (2) there is strong evidence for credit transfer – whilst accountability for these services are attributed to grassroots actors and there is strong correlation between service efficacy and political support, political support increases only for the central government level. The results show how the new programs of social service outsourcing and incorporation of non-governmental organizations in service provision can increase support for the party-state.

*Long-Term Effects of Authoritarian Repression: Evidence from the Gwangju Massacre in South Korea, 1980* (under review)

What are the long-term effects of authoritarian repression on political trust after democratization? Using the Gwangju Massacre in South Korea as a case study, this paper finds that indirect and direct experience of state-perpetrated violence of the critical-period cohort—who were aged 17–25 during the incident—can have long-term negative effects on trust levels towards the government. Difference-in-Difference analysis of national survey data collected in 2008 and 2012 reveals that contrary to recent scholarship, indirect or direct experience with violence has long-term negative consequences on government trust. Results are robust even when including significant covariates of institutional theories of political culture, such as interpersonal trust, evaluation of government performance, as well as satisfaction with the economy. Drawing from memory studies, this paper argues that the effects are due to collective memory formed during the critical period.
