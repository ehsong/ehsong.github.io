My research centers on civil society and NGO policies in China, China's foreign policy, and international affairs in Asia-Pacific. My other research area is authoritarianism and personalization of power. I have experience using a wide variety of methods including fieldwork, surveys, statistical analyses, and text analyses. More recently, I am using computational methods to collect data and applying text mining to uncover discourse and narratives, as well as quantitative analysis of survey data and survey experiments to gauage micro-level causal effects.

During my doctoral studies at Stanford, I investigated NGO-state relations in China, focusing on the evolution of civil society and NGO policies and its effect on political trust. This research led me to undertake Mandarin Chinese language training at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (2014, 2015), conduct fieldwork in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan (2015-2018), where I interviewed grassroots NGOs and neighborhood-level government institutions. My project also led to a pre-doctoral fellowship at the [School of Development and Public Policy at Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/2019/0514/c295a96700/page.psp) (2017-2018). There, I conducted an original survey on citizen perceptions of social services outsourced to NGOs and their impact on political trust. This research was funded by the [Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies](https://fsi.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University and the [Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society (PACS)](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/). The findings have been published in peer-reviewed journals such as *Chinese Political Science Review*, *Asian Politics & Policy*, and and as a book chapter in *Critical Issues in Contemporary China (Routledge)*. I am currently developing a book based on my doctoral research.

In my post-doctoral period at GIGA, I started a second strand of research on international affairs in the Asia-Pacific, with special focus on China's foreign policy and US-allies' reaction to China's influence in the region. This research draws theories from works that examine intersection between public opinion, media, and foreign policy; and empirical evidence from survey and computational text analysis. My findings have been published or are forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals such as *Asian Survey*, *Asian Perspective*, the *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, and *Australian Journal of International Affairs*. I have also contributed to policy outlets such as *The Diplomat* and *East Asia Forum*.

My third area of research investigates personalism—how executives personalize power—and politics within personalist autocracies. This research draws from literature on comparative authoritarianism, autocratization, democratic backsliding, and insights from Northeast Asian countries like China and the two Koreas. The findings have been published or forthcoming in *Journal of East Asian Studies*, *Korea Observer*, and [GIGA Working Paper](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/publications/giga-working-papers/personnel-institutions-power-revisiting-concept-of-executive-personalisation).

### Works in Progress

<details style="display:inline"><summary>Mapping the Concept of Civil Society in China (with Runya Qiaoan)</summary><br><p>Studies on civil society in China has suffered from a positivist bias where civil society is often conceptualized as the NGO sector. This conceptualization dismisses cultural and social contexts that distinguishes the how the concept of civil society is used and discussed in China. By leveraging a large corpus of text data and computational text analysis on scholarly articles on civil society in China from 2002 to 2021 and public discussions on the concept of civil society on online forums and social media, this article aims to uncover the major conceptual discussions on civil society in China and highlight how they differ from conceptualizations in western political thought.</p></details><ul><li><p>Part of the research presented at Digital Scholarship in East Asian Studies Conference, Max Planck Institute of History of Science & Berlin State Library, Berlin July 2024</p></li></ul>    

<details style="display:inline"><summary>Public Opinion on Cross-Strait Tensions in South Korea (with Doyoung Lee)</summary><br><p>South Korea has established a security alliance with the United States, yet its principal trading partner is China. This three-way association poses challenging foreign policy decisions for South Korea, particularly amid the backdrop of the intense rivalry between the United States and China. One of the dilemmas involves aligning with the U.S. and Taiwan concerning military tensions in the Taiwan Strait. This decision is not only shaped by national interests but also by domestic factors such as public sentiment. This article explores South Korean public attitudes toward the escalating tensions between the U.S. and China over Taiwan, aiming to provide insight into the factors influencing their preferences. The analysis relies on data from social media, news sources, and surveys.</p></details><ul><li><p>Previous version presented at APSA 2024, Philadephia; Social Science Korea Studies Europe Network (SoKEN) Ca'Foscari Venice 2024</p></li></ul>
