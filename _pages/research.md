My research interests span across topics such as civil society and NGO policy, authoritarianism, and international affairs in East Asia with a regional focus primarily on China and secondarily on the two Koreas. I have experience using a wide variety of methods including fieldwork, surveys, statistical analyses, and text analyses. More recently, I am using computational methods to collect data and applying text mining to uncover discourse and narratives, as well as quantitative analysis of survey data and survey experiments to gauage micro-level causal effects.

## NGO Policy Under Authoritarianism

*Book Project*     
**NGOs, the State, and Legitimacy in Contemporary China**

What explains the growth of the NGO sector in China during the recent decades? Departing from previous works that focus on the angecy of societal actors, I draw attention to state incentives in promoting the growth of the civic sector. The state initiatives that led to the increase emerge during the two periods: the early 2000s, when NGOs were used as vehicles of bureaucratic streamlining, and the post-2011 period, when NGOs are promoted as service deliverers at the grassroots level with the ultimate goal of minimizing social instability. Three questions addressed in my book-length dissertation are: (1) why has the party-state created institutional space for NGOs? (2) what explains the variation in the success of bureaucratic streamlining that involves the use of NGOs to downsize the bureaucracy in the early 2000s? (3) How is the party-state promoting the growth of service-oriented NGOs in the post-2011 period, and what are the effects of these services on citizens’ perception of the state? Drawing on theories of public sector reform, authoritarian politics, and non-state service provision, and evidence from fieldwork, text analyses, government statistical data and an original survey conducted in the field, my project comprehensively demonstrate how an authoritarian state such as China can counterintuitively utilize non-governmental organizations and civil society to serve its interests.

## Xenophobia, Nationalism, and Foreign Policy Attitudes

My other research agenda lies in examining correlates of foreign policy attitudes, notably xenophobia and nationalism. My recent works have centered on examining the determinants of Sinophobia and its impact on foreign policy attitudes in South Korea. With the case China, I examine the interlink between nationalism and hawkish foreign policy attitudes. I draw evidence from qualitative text analyses, survey experiments, and statistical analyses of public opinion data.

## China and the International Order

My last research agenda lies in understanding how China interacts with the liberal international order, notably human rights regime and the security regime. I draw empirical evidence from text analyses and text mining of state media data as well as qualitative examinations of UN reports.

## Personalization of Executive Power

At GIGA, I am part of the project [“COVID-19 and Executive Personalization in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and the MENA Region”](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/research-and-transfer/projects/covid-19-executive-personalization-sub-saharan-africa-asia-latin-america-mena-region) which examines executive personalization in 36 countries. This project is funded by the German Research Foundation. I have several working papers building on the conceptual framework our team has established during our project.

Evidence points to an increasing personalisation of political power by chief executives (CEs) in recent years. It is often argued that such personalisation contributes to the current trend of autocratisation and the global decline of democracy. Yet, our understanding of the degree and kind remain fractured, not least because there is a plethora of tacit understandings, definitions, and concepts of what political personalisation is. While many argue that personalisation relates to the rising dominance of the CE over other political actors, there is much disagreement over who these actors are. Moreover, while personalisation can occur in both autocracies and democracies, scholarship is still siloed into regime-types. Addressing these gaps, we develop a framework that defines personalisation as a process in which the CE centralises power to make political decisions by weakening the constraining capacities of all relevant actors during stages of the policy process. We propose that CEs can achieve this through three distinct strategies – personnel management, institutional engineering, and power arrogation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our conceptual framework with illustrations from democracies and autocracies of the Global South.

Despite accumulation of a large corpus of literature on the role of legislatures and parties, it is unclear whether these institutions function as a co-optation mechanism, especially when legislatures do not function as an arena of deliberation. We draw attention to personnel management, which involves management of promotions, demotions and movement of positions of cadres within the party-state. We argue that personnel management is a more concrete measure of access to rents by elites. Personnel management is an institution that dictators use to credibly commit to power sharing but at the same time constrain elites from involving in collective action. We test the implications of the theory using a unique data set we constructed which contains information on 2,631 career trajectory events of 320 cadres in North Korea.

## China and Democracy

Albeit being a non-democratic country, the Communist Party of China has not neglected the idea of 'democracy' - the earliest discussion of democracy goes back to 2009 when Yu Keping, advisor to Hu Jintao released an essay "Democracy is a Good Thing". More recently, the idea of democracy has been again mentioned in the white paper released by the CCP before the Democracy Summit headed by President Biden in December 2021. This project aims to examine the history of how democracy has been interpreted in China and how it is being used as a legitmizing tool for the CCP. In addition, this project also aims to examine how "democracy with Chinese characteristics" affects international audience and their interpretation of China's soft power.
