My research interests span across topics such as civil society and NGO policy, authoritarianism, and international affairs in East Asia with a regional focus primarily on China and secondarily on the two Koreas. My methodological interests lies in survey experiments and text mining.

## Authoritarianism

### NGO Policy Under Authoritarianism

My dissertation work has centered on answering the question on why China has allowed the growth of the NGO sector despite its potential threat towards regime stability. This work touches not only upon state-society relations in China but authoritarianism as well. My work has culminated in a book project and peer-reviewed articles \& articles under review.

### Personalization

At GIGA, I am part of the project [“COVID-19 and Executive Personalization in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and the MENA Region”](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/research-and-transfer/projects/covid-19-executive-personalization-sub-saharan-africa-asia-latin-america-mena-region) which examines executive personalization in 36 countries. This project is funded by the German Research Foundation. I have several working papers building on the conceptual framework our team has established during our project.

* Personnel Management as a Credible Commitment Mechanism: Evidence from North Korea, 1994-2014 (with Jacob Reidhead)
  * Previous version presented at MPSA, Chicago IL; Stanford Network Forum, Stanford University; Authoritarian Politics System Group Workshop (TBD); GIGA Workshop on Authoritarian Politics (TBD)

Despite accumulation of a large corpus of literature on the role of legislatures and parties, it is unclear whether these institutions function as a co-optation mechanism, especially when legislatures do not function as an arena of deliberation. We draw attention to personnel management, which involves management of promotions, demotions and movement of positions of cadres within the party-state. We argue that personnel management is a more concrete measure of access to rents by elites. Personnel management is an institution that dictators use to credibly commit to power sharing but at the same time constrain elites from involving in collective action. We test the implications of the theory using a unique data set we constructed which contains information on 2,631 career trajectory events of 320 cadres in North Korea.

* Hints of Personalization after COVID19 in South Korea (with Ines Miral)

Despite recent events alluding to increased power of the chief executive after COVID19, there has been no theoretical framework that examines how the pandemic has spurred personalization events. By examining the case of South Korea, we show how the executive power was personalized mainly via personnel management. We also identify attempts of personalization via violence yet administrative court rulings show that courts have played a role in checking excessive restrictions on mass protests. We also extend our analyses to compare personalization trends under the previous Park administration to show how personalization trends differed under two administrations.

## Xenophobia, Nationalism, and Foreign Policy Attitudes

My third research agenda lies in examining determinants of foreign policy attitudes, notably xenophobia and nationalism. With the case of South Korea, I examine determinants of recent increase in Sinophobia and its implications on foreign policy attitudes. With the case China, I examine the interlink between nationalism and hawkish foreign policy attitudes. I draw evidence from qualitative text analyses, survey experiments, and statistical analyses of public opinion data.

* COVID19 and Anti-Chinese Sentiment in South Korea  

COVID19 has led to increased anti-Chinese sentiment around the world, yet we know less about the exact link. By examining the case of South Korea, I find that anti-Chinese sentiment was deliberately incited due to domestic political factors: the conservatives used xenophobic narratives to compete with the liberal incumbent party. The deliberate crafting of the narrative was then replicated in news media and was absorbed by the public. The xenophobic narratives targeted at the Chinese has led to increase in anti-Chinese sentiment, even in topics unrelated to COVID19. I show evidence using qualitative text analyses, natural language processing and readings of congressional debates, news titles and op-ed titles, and 700K tweets collected between 2019 and 2021.

## Projects Under Development

*'Democracy' as a Legitimizing Tool in China*

Albeit being a non-democratic country, the Communist Party of China has not neglected the idea of 'democracy' - the earliest discussion of democracy goes back to 2009 when Yu Keping, advisor to Hu Jintao released an essay "Democracy is a Good Thing". More recently, the idea of democracy has been again mentioned in the white paper released by the CCP before the Democracy Summit headed by President Biden in December 2021. This project aims to examine the history of how democracy has been interpreted in China and how it is being used as a legitmizing tool for the CCP. In addition, this project also aims to examine how "democracy with Chinese characteristics" affects international audience and their interpretation of China's soft power.
