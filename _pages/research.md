My research interests span across a number of topics in comparative politics and international relations with a regional focus primarily on China and secondarily on the two Koreas:

- NGO policy and civil society in authoritarian states
- Political attitudes (political trust)
- Foreign policy attitudes
- Institutions in authoritarian states and authoritarian resilience
- Democratic backsliding and autocratization
- Soft power and nationalism

At GIGA, I am part of the project ["COVID-19 and Executive Personalization in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and the MENA Region"](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/projects/covid-19-executive-personalization-saharan-africa-asia-latin-america-mena-region/) which examines executive personalization in 36 countries. This project is funded by the [German Research Foundation](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/index.html).

*How Air Pollution Coverage Exacerbates Anti-Chinese Sentiment in South Korea: Evidence from Twitter and Survey*

- Previous version presented at 2019 APSA, Washington D.C. [[iPoster]](https://apsa2019-apsa.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=DF-1D-34-3D-64-33-21-12-B0-42-57-A1-87-AC-68-E1)

The issue of air pollutants allegedly originating from China has become a hotly debated issue in South Korea in the recent few years. Despite the government's neutral stance, there has been increased backlash from the Korean civil society against China demanding responsibility and accountability. How as the media reported about China regarding air pollutants in South Korea? What is the effect of media reports on air pollution on public perception of China? This work draws evidence from text mining of news headlines, twitter data, and a survey experiment to answer this question. This work aims to contribute to understanding trends in anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea as well as international relations literature on media and foreign policy attitudes.

*How China Violates International Human Rights Law: Evidence from CIRI and UPR Database (1982-2011)* (with Joanne Yang)

Despite Chinaâ€™s growing participation and accession to international human rights treaties, China continues to transgress the physical integrity rights of its citizens. In the question of whether China is able to effectively uphold human rights standards outlined in international human rights law, we find that China shows a lack of adherence to both treaties with a recent trend of more public grievances and oppression of ethnic and religious minorities. Rather, China maintains a distinct view of human rights norms that prioritizes economic development, national sovereignty, and non-interference. This work aims to contribute to expanding empirical understanding of human rights violations in China over time.

*Personnel Management in a Single Party Authoritarian State: Findings from North Korea, 1994-2014* (with Jacob Reidhead)

Despite accumulation of a large corpus of literature on the role of legislatures and parties, it is unclear whether these institutions function as a co-optation mechanism, especially when legislatures do not function as an arena of deliberation. We draw attention to personnel management, which involves management of promotions, demotions and movement of positions of cadres within the party-state. We argue that personnel management is a more concrete measure of access to rents by elites. Personnel management is an institution that dictators use to credibly commit to power sharing but at the same time constrain elites from involving in collective action. We test the implications of the theory using a unique data set we constructed which contains information on 2,631 career trajectory events of 320 cadres in North Korea.

**Projects Under Development**

*'Democracy' as a Legitimizing Tool in China*

Albeit being a non-democratic country, the Communist Party of China has not neglected the idea of 'democracy' - the earliest discussion of democracy goes back to 2009 when Yu Keping, advisor to Hu Jintao released an essay "Democracy is a Good Thing". More recently, the idea of democracy has been again mentioned in the white paper released by the CCP before the Democracy Summit headed by President Biden in December 2021. This project aims to examine the history of how democracy has been interpreted in China and how it is being used as a legitmizing tool for the CCP. In addition, this project also aims to examine how "democracy with Chinese characteristics" affects international audience and their interpretation of China's soft power.

*Domestic and International Consequences of Chinese INGO Operations Overseas*

Other than promotion of domestic NGOs, China has been also promoting internationalization of NGOs in the recent decades. According to a recent database, [approximately 130 Chinese INGOs are engaged in 294 development projects](https://leidenasiacentre.nl/launch-of-the-chinese-ngo-internationalization-database/). Drawing from literature on soft power, nationalism, and regime legitimacy in the context of Chinese politics, this project aims to examine the political consequences of China's internationalization of NGOs at both domestic and international levels.
