My research centers on civil society and NGO policies in China; China's diplomacy; and attitudes towards China. My other research areas include personalization of executive power in both democray and autocracy contexts. I have experience using a wide variety of methods including fieldwork, surveys, statistical analyses, and text analyses. More recently, I am using computational methods to collect data and applying text mining to uncover discourse and narratives, as well as quantitative analysis of survey data and survey experiments to gauage micro-level causal effects.

During my doctoral studies at Stanford, I investigated NGO-state relations in China, focusing on the evolution of civil society and NGO policies. This research led me to undertake Mandarin Chinese language training in Beijing (2014, 2015), conduct fieldwork in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan (2015-2017), where I interviewed grassroots NGOs and neighborhood-level government institutions. My project also led to a pre-doctoral fellowship at the School of Development and Public Policy at Fudan University (2017-2018). There, I conducted an original survey on citizen perceptions of social services outsourced to NGOs and their impact on political trust. This research was funded by the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University and the Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society (PACS). The findings have been published in journals such as *Chinese Political Science Review*, *Asian Politics & Policy*, and and as a book chapter in *Critical Issues in Contemporary China (Routledge)*. I am currently developing a book based on my doctoral research, examining state-NGO relations in China.

In my post-doctoral period at GIGA, I started a second strand of research on international affairs in East Asia, specifically analyzing the rise of anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea and its impact on foreign policy attitudes. This research draws on theories of public opinion, foreign policy, and media influence. My findings have been published or are forthcoming in journals such as *Asian Survey*, *Asian Perspective*, and the *Journal of Chinese Political Science*. Additionally, I have explored China's foreign policy signaling in maritime disputes, analyzing over 31,000 state media reports to understand how China communicates differently to domestic and international audiences, balancing its image as a responsible power with the need to satisfy a hawkish domestic audience. This work will be published in the *Australian Journal of International Affairs*.

Currently I am working on a few topics, including 1) how China is intellectualizing state-society relations, and 2) South Korea's public opinion on cross-strait tensions. I am open to collaborations and starting new projects, so if you are interested please contact me at esther.song@uib.no.

<details style="display:inline"><summary>9. How Outsourcing Social Services to NGOs Bolsters Political Trust in China: Evidence from Shanghai. <em>Chinese Political Science Review</em>, 9, 36–62 (2024).<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-021-00207-z" target="_blank">[Open Access Link]</a></summary><br><p>The Chinese Communist Party has recently acknowledged its attempts to bolster good governance by outsourcing public and social service functions to social organizations—non-profit organizations, either created by relevant government bureaus, developed through non-profit incubators, or voluntarily created civil society groups. Do these services gender political trust for the party-state? Using matching methods on an original survey data collected in communities in Shanghai, this article reveals two important findings. (1) Service efficacy—the internal belief that one can affect the content of the services show strong correlation with political trust and the relationship is stronger than that between service quality and political support. (2) There is strong evidence for credit transfer—whilst accountability for these services is attributed to grassroots actors and there is strong correlation between service efficacy and political support, political support increases only for the central government level. The results show how the new programs of social service outsourcing and incorporation of non-governmental organizations in service provision can increase support for the party-state.</p></details>

Moving beyond the extant literature that focuses on the strategic relationship between NGOs and the local state, this article argues that the growth can be also attributed to the central state which has focused on the promotion of different types of NGOs throughout time. The proactive role of the central state has become more conspicuous under Xi administration where the party-state plays a more active role in maneuvering the growth of a service-oriented third sector. This adaptive strategy has led to the counterintuitive phenomenon of an increase in institutional space for NGOs in authoritarian China, especially the social service-oriented NGOs in recent years. This article draws from theories of institutional change to explain the process through which the central state has expanded institutional space for NGOs throughout time.</p></details>
     
### Attitudes Towards China

<details style="display:inline"><summary>7. Air Pollution Coverage, Anti-Chinese Sentiment, and Attitudes towards Foreign Policy in South Korea. <em>Journal of Chinese Political Science</em>, 28, 571–592 (2023).<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11366-023-09849-z" target="_blank">[Open Access Link]</a></summary><br><p>Air pollutants allegedly originating from China have become a thorny issue in South Korea. Despite a neutral view of the topic on the part of the South Korean government, recent public polls show a high correlation between the air pollution issue and negative sentiment toward China. How has the media reported on China regarding air pollutants in South Korea? What is the effect of media reports on air pollution on anti-Chinese sentiment and foreign policy attitudes? By examining news headlines and Twitter data in 2015 and 2018, this work finds that media reports blaming China for air pollution doubled during the 2015–2018 period. Discourse surrounding air pollution also shifted: negative sentiment directed at both the Chinese government and the Chinese people increased in 2018 compared to 2015. In addition, an original online survey experiment shows that China-blaming articles have a causal effect on increasing related resentment, particularly toward Chinese people, and that this effect is moderated by age group. Such articles have also had negative effects on foreign policy attitudes via increased anti-Chinese sentiment; greater hostility toward the Chinese people is found to have a causal effect on reduced support for strengthening relations with their country.</p></details>

Domestic elite-level narratives regarding China at the pandemic’s onset were highly polarized: conservative parties advocated border shutdowns, emphasizing China as originating the virus, while progressive parties warned that this would incite xenophobia. Did these narratives shape anti-Chinese sentiment, and what are their foreign policy effects? Using social media data, I show that despite the polarized narratives at the elite level, attitudes of both conservative and progressive voters became unfavorable toward China following COVID-19’s onset. Furthermore, statistical analyses of survey data show that this blame is strongly associated with negative perceptions of China. Although substantively not directly linked to foreign policy, blame of China is strongly associated with rejection of foreign policy alignment with China and a shift toward supporting alignment with the US. These results have implications for understanding public support of South Korea’s foreign policy amid US–China bifurcation.</p></details><ul><li><p>Previous version presented at <a href="https://sinofon.cz/surveys/" target="blank_">Sinophone Borderlands: Global Views on China Conference, Palacky University</a>; ISA Montreal 2023</p></li></ul>

### China's Diplomacy & International Affairs in the Asia-Pacific

<details style="display:inline"><summary>5. China's Dual Signaling in Maritime Disputes (with Sung Eun Kim). Forthcoming in <em>Australian Journal of International Affairs</em>.</summary><br><p>How does China signal foreign policy intentions to domestic and international audience during territorial conflicts? While China can signal its resolve by provoking nationalism at home, doing so may risk appearing threatening to neighboring countries in the region. We argue that China resolves the dilemma by sending different types of messages to domestic and international audiences. Focusing on China’s maritime conflicts in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, we examine China’s narratives regarding the maritime disputes through the analysis of state-run media. Our findings from text mining and topic analyses of more than 31,000 state media reports from 2002 to 2021 suggest that China signals to the international audience on international cooperation emphasizing diplomatic and peaceful resolutions while relatively less in domestic media. The analyses have implications on how China signals foreign policy intentions amidst rising nationalism.</p></details><ul><li><p>Previous version presented at 2023 APSA Los Angeles; GIGA Workshop on Foreign Policy 2023</p></li></ul>

<details style="display:inline"><summary>4. South Korea’s Narratives on China: Evidence from Elites, Masses, and Scholars. Forthcoming in <em>Asian Perspective.</em></summary><br><p>What are the narratives on China in South Korea since the normalization of two countries in 1992? Drawing from computational analysis of scholarly articles, op-eds, and polls, this paper presents a descriptive picture of narratives on China in South Korea put forward by different sectors of the society - the elites, masses, and the scholars. The finding shows that while scholarly narratives in South Korea towards China have remained balanced, within domestic politics the narrative towards China has become increasingly polarized in the post-2015 period. Factors contributing to this polarization include China’s hawkish response to South Korea’s foreign policy choices, most evidently demonstrated during the THAAD dispute. Other recent issues include the COVID-19 which has sparked debate at the elite level on whether weak enforcement of border controls towards travelers from China demonstrate lack of sovereignty and an overt pro-China attitude by then incumbent Moon administration.</p></details><ul><li><p>Previous version presented at Helmut Schmidt Stiftung Conference on International China Narratives in Politics and Economics Since 1945, Hamburg Germany 2023.</p></li></ul>

### Personalization of Executive Power

<details style="display:inline"><summary>3. Personalization of Executive Power after COVID-19 in South Korea. <em>Korea Observer</em>, 54(4), 641-670 (2023) (with Ines Miral). <a href="https://scholar.kyobobook.co.kr/article/detail/4010068022214" target="_blank">[Link]</a></summary><br><p>How has COVID-19 affected the personalization of executive power in South Korea? To answer this question, we draw on the conceptual framework of personalization concerning democracies and autocracies. We find that, personalization attempts were made via mechanism of personnel management (e.g., the appointment of allies within the pandemic-response bureaucracy) and via mechanism violence which consists of enacting the Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act, which restricted the freedom of assembly of anti-government forces. However, personnel management was more pronounced than the mechanism of violence due to the role of administrative courts and the National Human Rights Commission, which prevented an outright ban of freedom of assembly. Under the Park administration, many personalization attempts were made but not fully realized due to the fragmented command chain within the pandemic bureaucracy. We discuss the prospects of continued personalization under the Yoon administration via personnel management in the pandemic bureaucracy.</p></details><ul><li><p>Funded by German Research Foundation, DFG <a href="https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/research-and-transfer/projects/covid-19-executive-personalization-sub-saharan-africa-asia-latin-america-mena-region" target="blank_">COVID-19 and Executive Personalization in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and the MENA Region</a></p></li><li><p>Part of the research presented at Computational Social Science Workshop, Graduate School of International Studies, Ewha Womans University, Seoul South Korea October 2023</p></li></ul>

When empirically assessing whether China adheres to international human rights norms outlined in international human rights law, we find that there is variation across treaties and across time—China shows relatively higher adherence to norms pertaining to gender equality, economic rights, social and cultural rights, compared to rights to freedom from torture. Improvements in adherence to gender equality, economic rights, social and cultural rights have shown relative improvement over time compared to rights to freedom from torture due to previous efforts to improve welfare under Hu-Wen administration (2002–2012). We additionally find that the variation in adherence across treaties stems from China's distinct human rights norms, which prioritize economic development and national sovereignty over indivisibility of human rights. Our findings contribute to furthering existing understanding of China's relationship with the international human rights regime.</p></details><ul><li><p>Cited by <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-encourage-china-to-become-a-law-abiding-member-of-the-rules-based-international-order-218223" target="blank_a">The Conversation</a></p></li></ul>

Using the Gwangju Massacre in South Korea as a case study, this article finds that indirect and direct experience of state-perpetrated violence of the critical-period cohort—who were aged 17–25 during the incident—can have long-term negative effects on trust levels towards the government. Difference-in-difference analysis of national survey data collected in 2008 and 2012 reveals that experience with violence has long-term negative consequences on government trust. Results are robust even when including significant covariates of institutional theories and cultural theories, such as interpersonal trust, evaluation of government performance, as well as satisfaction with the economy. Drawing from memory studies, this article argues that the effects are due to collective memory formed during the critical period.</p></details><br>

## Civil Society & NGO Policy Under Authoritarianism

*Book Project*     
**NGOs, the State, and Legitimacy in Contemporary China**

What explains the growth of the NGO sector in China during the recent decades? Departing from previous works that focus on the agency of societal actors, I draw attention to state incentives in promoting the growth of the civic sector. The state initiatives that led to the increase emerge during the two periods: the early 2000s, when NGOs were used as vehicles of bureaucratic streamlining, and the post-2011 period, when NGOs are promoted as service deliverers at the grassroots level with the ultimate goal of minimizing social instability. Three questions addressed in my book-length dissertation are: (1) why has the party-state created institutional space for NGOs? (2) what explains the variation in the success of bureaucratic streamlining that involves the use of NGOs to downsize the bureaucracy in the early 2000s? (3) How is the party-state promoting the growth of service-oriented NGOs in the post-2011 period, and what are the effects of these services on citizens’ perception of the state? Drawing on theories of public sector reform, authoritarian politics, and non-state service provision, and evidence from fieldwork, text analyses, government statistical data and an original survey conducted in the field, my project comprehensively demonstrate how an authoritarian state such as China can counterintuitively utilize non-governmental organizations and civil society to serve its interests.

<details style="display:inline"><summary>The Political Origins of NGO Sector Expansion Under Authoritarianism: Evidence from Case Comparison of Three Post-Communist Countries.</summary><br><p>What explains the expansion of the NGO sector among authoritarian states in recent decades? Why do authoritarian states repress civil society yet are favorable to certain types of NGOs – the service-oriented NGOs? Using controlled case comparisons of three post-communist authoritarian states – Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, this article demonstrates that NGO sector expansion – particularly the introduction of NGO outsourcing, has been introduced with the policies of welfare liberalization. The antecedent to welfare liberalization can be traced to different political economic pressures that have emerged after the Soviet disintegration. The article contributes to the understanding of the emerging convergence of paradoxical approach towards the NGO sector among authoritarian states which marks a dual strategy of repression of certain sectors – the rights-based groups and co-optation of service-oriented NGOs.</p></details>
