My research interests span across topics such as civil society and NGO policy, authoritarianism, and international affairs in East Asia with a regional focus primarily on China and secondarily on the two Koreas. I have experience using a wide variety of methods including fieldwork, surveys, statistical analyses, and text analyses. More recently, I am using computational methods to collect data and applying text mining to uncover discourse and narratives, as well as quantitative analysis of survey data and survey experiments to gauage micro-level causal effects.

The Chinese Communist Party has recently acknowledged its attempts to bolster good governance by outsourcing public and social service functions to social organi- zations—non-profit organizations, either created by relevant government bureaus, developed through non-profit incubators, or voluntarily created civil society groups. Do these services gender political trust for the party-state? Using matching meth- ods on an original survey data collected in communities in Shanghai, this article reveals two important findings. (1) Service efficacy—the internal belief that one can affect the content of the services show strong correlation with political trust and the relationship is stronger than that between service quality and political support. (2) There is strong evidence for credit transfer—whilst accountability for these services is attributed to grassroots actors and there is strong correlation between service efficacy and political support, political support increases only for the central gov- ernment level. The results show how the new programs of social service outsourc- ing and incorporation of non-governmental organizations in service provision can increase support for the party-state.

What are the long-term effects of authoritarian repression on political trust in a post-democra- tization context? Using the Gwangju Massacre in South Korea as a case study, this article finds that indirect and direct experience of state-perpetrated violence of the critical-period cohort— who were aged 17–25 during the incident—can have long-term negative effects on trust levels towards the government. Difference-in-difference analysis of national survey data collected in 2008 and 2012 reveals that experience with violence has long-term negative consequences on gov- ernment trust. Results are robust even when including significant covariates of institutional theor- ies and cultural theories, such as interpersonal trust, evaluation of government performance, as well as satisfaction with the economy. Drawing from memory studies, this article argues that the effects are due to collective memory formed during the critical period.

## Xenophobia, Nationalism, and Foreign Policy Attitudes

My other research agenda lies in examining correlates of foreign policy attitudes, notably xenophobia and nationalism. My recent works have centered on examining the determinants of Sinophobia and its impact on foreign policy attitudes in South Korea. With the case China, I examine the interlink between nationalism and hawkish foreign policy attitudes. I draw evidence from qualitative text analyses, survey experiments, and statistical analyses of public opinion data.

Despite the alluded association with COVID19 and increased anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea, there has not been detailed examination of how COVID19 affected the increase in anti-Chinese sentiment. Using Twitter data that discusses the keyword ‘China’ from period 2019 to 2021, this paper finds several nuanced evidence of association between COVID19 and anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea. Statistical analyses of sentiment scores and hate scores from text mining shows that anti-Chinese sentiment and anti-Chinese racism increased after the onset of COVID19. Yet, a detailed examination of topic trends show that increased racism is only moderately correlated with COVID19 or with politicization of the narrative surrounding the pandemic onset. Issues not directly related to COVID19, such as Korea-China relations and the debate surrounding hanbok reflected more anti-Chinese racism. The above findings imply that the politicized debate on border controls had at best a moderate association on generating anti-Chinese racism. Empirics are drawn from applying text mining, sentiment analysis, and hate speech detection on approximately 0.8 million tweets on China in Korean text gathered from Twitter.

## China and the International Order

My last research agenda lies in understanding how China interacts with the liberal international order, notably human rights regime and the security regime. I am also interested in examining correlates of China's soft power, measured by world-wide survey data on global views of China such as the [Sinofon](https://sinofon.cz/surveys/) and social media data.

## Personalization of Executive Power

At GIGA, I am part of the project [“COVID-19 and Executive Personalization in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and the MENA Region”](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/research-and-transfer/projects/covid-19-executive-personalization-sub-saharan-africa-asia-latin-america-mena-region) which examines executive personalization in 36 countries. This project is funded by the German Research Foundation. I have several working papers building on the conceptual framework our team has established during our project.

* Personnel Management as a Credible Commitment Mechanism: Evidence from North Korea, 1994-2014 (with Jacob Reidhead)
  * Previous version presented at MPSA, Chicago IL; Stanford Network Forum, Stanford University; Authoritarian Politics System Group Workshop (TBD); GIGA Workshop on Authoritarian Politics (TBD)

Despite accumulation of a large corpus of literature on the role of legislatures and parties, it is unclear whether these institutions function as a co-optation mechanism, especially when legislatures do not function as an arena of deliberation. We draw attention to personnel management, which involves management of promotions, demotions and movement of positions of cadres within the party-state. We argue that personnel management is a more concrete measure of access to rents by elites. Personnel management is an institution that dictators use to credibly commit to power sharing but at the same time constrain elites from involving in collective action. We test the implications of the theory using a unique data set we constructed which contains information on 2,631 career trajectory events of 320 cadres in North Korea.

* Hints of Personalization after COVID19 in South Korea (with Ines Miral). under review.

Despite recent events alluding to increased power of the chief executive after COVID19, there has been no theoretical framework nor an in-depth case study that examines how the pandemic has spurred personalization events. By examining the case of South Korea, we show how the executive power was personalized mainly via personnel management. We also identify attempts of personalization via violence yet administrative court rulings show that courts have played a role in checking excessive restrictions on mass protests. We also extend our analyses to compare personalization trends under the previous Park administration to show how personalization trends differed under two administrations. Our work draws evidence from news data systematically collected using a webscraper that amasses large amounts of news over time borrowing the search algorithm of Naver, the biggest news aggregator in South Korea.

## China and Democracy

Albeit being a non-democratic country, the Communist Party of China has not neglected the idea of 'democracy' - the earliest discussion of democracy goes back to 2009 when Yu Keping, advisor to Hu Jintao released an essay "Democracy is a Good Thing". More recently, the idea of democracy has been again mentioned in the white paper released by the CCP before the Democracy Summit headed by President Biden in December 2021. This project aims to examine the history of how democracy has been interpreted in China and how it is being used as a legitmizing tool for the CCP. In addition, this project also aims to examine how "democracy with Chinese characteristics" affects international audience and their interpretation of China's soft power.
