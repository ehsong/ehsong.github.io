My research centers on civil society and NGO policies in China; and China's diplomacy and perception of China in the Asia-Pacific. I have also interest in examining the concept of personalization of executive power in both democray and autocracy contexts. I have experience using a wide variety of methods including fieldwork, surveys, statistical analyses, and text analyses. More recently, I am using computational methods to collect data and applying text mining to uncover discourse and narratives, as well as quantitative analysis of survey data and survey experiments to gauage micro-level causal effects.

## Civil Society & NGO Policy Under Authoritarianism

*Book Project*     
**NGOs, the State, and Legitimacy in Contemporary China**

What explains the growth of the NGO sector in China during the recent decades? Departing from previous works that focus on the angecy of societal actors, I draw attention to state incentives in promoting the growth of the civic sector. The state initiatives that led to the increase emerge during the two periods: the early 2000s, when NGOs were used as vehicles of bureaucratic streamlining, and the post-2011 period, when NGOs are promoted as service deliverers at the grassroots level with the ultimate goal of minimizing social instability. Three questions addressed in my book-length dissertation are: (1) why has the party-state created institutional space for NGOs? (2) what explains the variation in the success of bureaucratic streamlining that involves the use of NGOs to downsize the bureaucracy in the early 2000s? (3) How is the party-state promoting the growth of service-oriented NGOs in the post-2011 period, and what are the effects of these services on citizens’ perception of the state? Drawing on theories of public sector reform, authoritarian politics, and non-state service provision, and evidence from fieldwork, text analyses, government statistical data and an original survey conducted in the field, my project comprehensively demonstrate how an authoritarian state such as China can counterintuitively utilize non-governmental organizations and civil society to serve its interests.

## China and Democracy

Albeit being a non-democratic country, the Communist Party of China has not neglected the idea of 'democracy' - the earliest discussion of democracy goes back to 2009 when Yu Keping, advisor to Hu Jintao released an essay "Democracy is a Good Thing". More recently, the idea of democracy has been again mentioned in the white paper released by the CCP before the Democracy Summit headed by President Biden in December 2021. This project aims to examine the history of how democracy has been interpreted in China and how it is being used as a legitmizing tool for the CCP. In addition, this project also aims to examine how "democracy with Chinese characteristics" affects international audience and their interpretation of China's soft power.
