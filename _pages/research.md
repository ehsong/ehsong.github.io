*Personnel Management in a Single Party Authoritarian State: Findings from North Korea, 1994-2014* (with Jacob Reidhead)

Despite accumulation of a large corpus of literature on the role of legislatures and parties, it is unclear whether these institutions function as a co-optation mechanism, especially when legislatures do not function as an arena of deliberation. We draw attention to personnel management, which involves management of promotions, demotions and movement of positions of cadres within the party-state. We argue that personnel management is a more concrete measure of access to rents by elites. Personnel management is an institution that dictators use to credibly commit to power sharing but at the same time constrain elites from involving in collective action. We test the implications of the theory using a unique data set we constructed which contains information on 2,631 career trajectory events of 320 cadres in North Korea.

*Media Framing, Pollution, and Support for Foreign Policy: Evidence from THAAD Missile Crisis*
[[2019 APSA iPoster]](https://apsa2019-apsa.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=DF-1D-34-3D-64-33-21-12-B0-42-57-A1-87-AC-68-E1)

What are the effects of media framing on foreign policy? Parting from previous works that have focused on how the media allow elite rhetoric, this project focuses on how non crucial information propagated by the media - information not directly related to the crisis creates media frame and affects attitudes towards foreign policy. I examine THAAD crisis, a foreign policy crisis that unfolded between South Korea and China during July 2016 - 2017 period over establishment of a missile base in Seongju, South Korea. Contrasting word counts of news titles pre and post-crisis period revealed that pollution emerges as a media frame used during the post-crisis period. Proportion of China-blaming articles out of all pollution related reports increased by 10% in the post-crisis period compared to the pre-crisis period. Text mining of twitter feeds shows that blame attribution became more salient during the post-crisis period. Sentiment analysis of tweets about China shows that sentiment towards China also worsened in the post-crisis period. A pilot survey experiment priming respondents with China-blaming revealed that those in the treatment group are more likely to support the domestic missile policy, less likely to be favorable towards China, and are more likely to have a negative perception of China-Korea relations.
