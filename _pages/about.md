Welcome to my website! I am a researcher with background in political science with expertise in Chinese politics and comparative politics. I recently received my Ph.D. in Political Science at Department of Political Science, Stanford University. My dissertation, *NGOs, the State, and Legitimacy in Contemporary China*, consists of essays on China's state-led initiatives to use civil society and NGOs to provide social services at the grassroots and resolve social discontent. My research was funded by Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford and Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford. In 2017-8 period, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at School of Social Development and Public Policy at Fudan University.

For more information on my dissertation project, please see [here](/dissertation/).

Besides the dissertation project, I have research interests in non-state service provision, political violence, political trust, and political institutions in authoritarian states with regional focus on China and East Asia (South and North Korea).

I am also passionate about finding actionable insights through data analysis, and have several experience in data consulting for tech startups. For more details, please see my linkedin bio [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eunhou-esther-song/).
