Welcome to my website! Starting January 2022, I am a research fellow at [German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/) in Hamburg, Germany. I am also concurrently a geopolitical risk analyst and consultant at [GeoQuant](https://geoquant.com/), which leverages political science concepts to measure political risk across 100+ countries. Before joining GIGA, I was an adjunct assistant professor at the department of political science at [Randolph-Macon College](https://www.rmc.edu/) in Virgina, United States. 

My research interests span across topics of consequences of political violence, media and foreign policy, and authoritarian institutions. My scholarship bridges political phenomenon in East Asia (China and the two Koreas) to the broader comparative politics and international relations literature.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science at Department of Political Science, Stanford University. My dissertation, *NGOs, the State, and Legitimacy in Contemporary China*, consists of essays on China's state-led initiatives to use civil society and NGOs to provide social services at the grassroots and resolve social discontent. My research was funded by [Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies](https://fsi.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, [Center for East Asian Studies](https://ceas.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, and [Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, and School of Social Development and Public Policy at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). During my graduate studies, I was a receipient of graduate scholarship from [Korea Foundation of Advanced Studies](http://www.kfas.or.kr/) funded by the SK group.
