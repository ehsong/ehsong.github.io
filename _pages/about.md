I am a research fellow at the [Institute for Asian Studies](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/institutes/giga-institute-for-asian-studies/) at [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/) in Hamburg, Germany. I conduct research on topics of civil society and NGO policy, political attitudes, authoritarianism, and international affairs in East Asia with a regional focus primarily on China and secondarily on the two Koreas. Part of my dissertation which examines how NGO service outsourcing in China affects political legitimacy has appeared in *Chinese Political Science Review*. I hold MA and PhD in Political Science from [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu). Previous to coming to Hamburg, I taught Chinese politics at [Randolph Macon College](https://www.rmc.edu/) in Virginia, USA.

My other current on-going projects include examining anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea particularly in relations to recent air pollution coverage in South Korean media. For this project, I use webscraped news data and text analyses to uncover topic trends in anti-Chinese discourse in social media.

Please see my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ODsDd7WNIOPJS446Zh2X7GkdUJVaZ_cZ/view?usp=sharing), [research](https://ehsong.github.io/research/), and [GIGA webpage](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/the-giga/team/song-esther) for more details.
