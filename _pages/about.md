Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Department of Political Science, Stanford University. I have interests in research with regional focus on China and East Asia (South and North Korea), with particular focus on topics of comparative politics - non-state service provision, political violence, and political institutions in authoritarian states. I am currently finishing my dissertation project "Politics of Public and Social Service Reforms in China", which is composed of essays on China's turn towards neoliberal practice in provision of public and social services, such as outsourcing with non-state actors (i.e. non-governmental organizations) for social service provision at the grassroots level. For more information on my dissertation project, please see [here](/dissertation/).

Before coming to Stanford, I obtained B.A. in Political Science and Economics at Korea University in Seoul, South Korea. I was born in South Korea and grew up in between Busan, South Korea and Cambridge, Massachusetts.
