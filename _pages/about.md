Welcome! I am an Associate Professor at the [Department of Government](https://www.uib.no/en/gov), [University of Bergen (UiB)](https://www.uib.no/en) and an associate at the [Institute for Asian Studies](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/institutes/giga-institute-for-asian-studies/) at [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/). 

I conduct research on politics and international relations of China, and international affairs in the Asia-Pacific. My research areas include civil society and NGO policy in China, global public perception of China, and China's foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific. My works are forthcoming or published in *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, *Australian Journal of International Affairs*, *Asian Survey*, and *The Diplomat*, among others.

Before coming to UiB I was a research fellow at the [Institute for Asian Studies](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/institutes/giga-institute-for-asian-studies/) at the [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/) and a pre-doctoral fellow at [School of Social Development and Public Policy, Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/2019/0514/c295a96700/page.htm) in Shanghai, China. I hold MA and PhD in Political Science from [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu).
