Welcome! I am a research fellow at the [Institute for Asian Studies](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/institutes/giga-institute-for-asian-studies/) at [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/). In January 2024, I will join [Department of Government](https://www.uib.no/en/gov) at [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en) as Associate Professor.  

I conduct research on topics of civil society and NGO policy, authoritarianism, and international affairs in East Asia with a regional focus primarily on China and secondarily on the two Koreas. My works have been published or forthcoming in *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, *Chinese Political Science Review*, *Asian Journal of Comparative Politics*, *International Area Studies Review*, *Asian Survey* and *The Diplomat*. My other current on-going projects inclue origins of civil society policy in autocracies; societal and state narratives on civil society in China; personalization and personalism in democracies and autocracies; foreign policy signaling during maritime disputes in China; public opinion on foreign policy in South Korea, among others.  

Previously, I taught Chinese politics at [Randolph Macon College](https://www.rmc.edu/) in Virginia, USA, and before that was a pre-doctoral fellow at [School of Social Development and Public Policy, Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/2019/0514/c295a96700/page.htm) in Shanghai, China. I hold MA and PhD in Political Science from [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu).
