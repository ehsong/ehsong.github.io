Welcome to my website! I am a political scientist interested in topics of civil society and the state, consequences of political violence, media and foreign policy, and authoritarian institutions that contributes to authoritarian resilience. My scholarship bridges political phenomenon in China and the two Koreas to the broader comparative politics and international relations literature.

Starting January 2022, I am a research fellow at [German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/) in Hamburg, Germany. I am also concurrently a geopolitical risk analyst and consultant at [GeoQuant](https://geoquant.com/), which leverages political science concepts to measure political risk across 100+ countries. I received Ph.D. in Political Science at Department of Political Science, Stanford University, and M.A. in Political Science at Stanford University. 

Please see my [CV](https://ehsong.github.io/files/SONG_CV2.pdf) and [research](https://ehsong.github.io/research/) page for more details.
