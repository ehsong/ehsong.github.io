Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Department of Political Science, Stanford University. I have interests in research with regional focus on China and East Asia (South and North Korea), with particular focus on topics of comparative politics - non-state service provision, political violence, and political institutions in authoritarian states. I am currently finishing my dissertation project "NGOs, the State, and Services in Reform China", which is composed of essays on the causes and consequences of China's promotion of non-governmental organizations for provision of public and social services. For more information on my dissertation project, please see [here](/dissertation/). My research was funded by Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford and Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford.

Before coming to Stanford, I obtained B.A. in Political Science and Economics at Korea University in Seoul, South Korea. I was born in South Korea and grew up in between Busan, South Korea and Cambridge, Massachusetts.
