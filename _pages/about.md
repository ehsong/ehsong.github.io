Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Department of Political Science, Stanford University. I am currently finishing my dissertation project *NGOs, the State, and Services in Contemporary China*, which consists of essays on China's state-led initiatives to use civil society and NGOs to provide social services at the grassroots and resolve social discontent. My research was funded by Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford and Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford. In 2017-8 period, I was a predoctoral fellow at School of Social Development and Public Policy at Fudan University.

For more information on my dissertation project, please see [here](/dissertation/).

Besides the dissertation project, I have research interests in non-state service provision, political violence, and political institutions in authoritarian states with regional focus on China and East Asia (South and North Korea).
