Welcome! I am an Associate Professor at the [Department of Government](https://www.uib.no/en/gov), [University of Bergen (UiB)](https://www.uib.no/en) and an associate at the [Institute for Asian Studies](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/institutes/giga-institute-for-asian-studies/) at [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/). In May 2025, I will be a Visiting Scholar at [Fudan Development Institute](https://fddi.fudan.edu.cn/fddien/main.htm).

I conduct research on politics of China, authoritarianism, and international affairs in Asia-Pacific. My works are forthcoming or published in *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, *Australian Journal of International Affairs*, *Asian Survey*, *Journal of East Asian Studies* and *The Diplomat*, among others.

My current [book project](https://esthersong.org/book/) focuses on explaining the paradox of NGO expansion in authoritarian China, showing how the state strategically fosters and controls civil society using mechanisms of outsourcing to enhance governance while mitigating political risks.

Before coming to UiB I was a research fellow at the [Institute for Asian Studies](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/institutes/giga-institute-for-asian-studies/) at the [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/) and a pre-doctoral fellow at [School of Social Development and Public Policy, Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/2019/0514/c295a96700/page.htm) in Shanghai, China. I hold MA and PhD in Political Science from [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu).

Please see my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0TXDcZUAAAAJ&hl=en), [research](https://ehsong.github.io/research/), [invited talks and conferences](https://ehsong.github.io/talks/), and [CV](https://ehsong.github.io/cv/) for more details.
