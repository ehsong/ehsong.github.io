Welcome! I am a research fellow at the [Institute for Asian Studies](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/institutes/giga-institute-for-asian-studies/) at [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/) and incoming postdoctoral scholar at [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de/en/). I conduct research on topics of civil society and NGO policy, authoritarianism, and international affairs in East Asia with a regional focus primarily on China and secondarily on the two Koreas. My works have been published or forthcoming in *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, *Chinese Political Science Review*, *Asian Journal of Comparative Politics*, and *The Diplomat*. Previous to coming to Hamburg, I taught Chinese politics at [Randolph Macon College](https://www.rmc.edu/) in Virginia, USA, and before that was a pre-doctoral fellow at [School of Social Development and Public Policy, Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/2019/0514/c295a96700/page.htm) in Shanghai, China. I hold MA and PhD in Political Science from [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu).

My other current on-going projects include anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea and its effects on foreign policy attitudes; China and the international security regime; domestic and international consequences of Chinese democracy, among others. My research has been funded by a number of institutions including [Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/); [Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University](https://fsi.stanford.edu/), and [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). I received my Mandarin Chinese training at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in Beijing, China.
