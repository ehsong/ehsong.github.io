Welcome! I am a research fellow at the [Institute for Asian Studies](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/institutes/giga-institute-for-asian-studies/) at [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/) in Hamburg, Germany. I conduct research on topics of civil society and NGO policy, authoritarianism, and international affairs in East Asia with a regional focus primarily on China and secondarily on the two Koreas. My works have been published in *Chinese Political Science Review*, *Asian Journal of Comparative Politics*, and *The Diplomat*. Previous to coming to Hamburg, I taught Chinese politics at [Randolph Macon College](https://www.rmc.edu/) in Virginia, USA. I hold MA and PhD in Political Science from [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu).

My other current on-going projects include anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea and its effects on foreign policy attitudes; China and the international security regime; domestic and international consequences of Chinese democracy, among others.
