Welcome! I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Government](https://www.uib.no/en/gov) at [University of Bergen (UiB)](https://www.uib.no/en) and an associate at the [Institute for Asian Studies](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/institutes/giga-institute-for-asian-studies/) at [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/). I conduct research on topics of civil society and NGO policy, authoritarianism, and international affairs in East Asia with a regional focus primarily on China and secondarily on the two Koreas. 

My works have been published or forthcoming in *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, *Chinese Political Science Review*, *Asian Journal of Comparative Politics*, *International Area Studies Review*, *Asian Survey*, *Korea Observer*, and *The Diplomat*.

Before starting professorship I was a research fellow at [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/) and a pre-doctoral fellow at [School of Social Development and Public Policy, Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/2019/0514/c295a96700/page.htm) in Shanghai, China. I hold MA and PhD in Political Science from [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu).
