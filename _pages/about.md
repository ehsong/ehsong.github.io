Welcome to my website! I am a political scientist with expertise in Chinese politics and concentration on comparative politics and international relations. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science at Department of Political Science, Stanford University in June 2020. My dissertation, *NGOs, the State, and Legitimacy in Contemporary China*, consists of essays on China's state-led initiatives to use civil society and NGOs to provide social services at the grassroots and resolve social discontent. My research was funded by [Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies](https://fsi.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, [Center for East Asian Studies](https://ceas.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, and [Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/) at Stanford. In 2017-8 period, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at School of Social Development and Public Policy at Fudan University. During my graduate studies, I was a receipient of graduate scholarship from [Korea Foundation of Advanced Studies](http://www.kfas.or.kr/) funded by the SK group.

For more information on my dissertation project, please see [here](/dissertation/).

Aside from my dissertation, my research interests span across topics of consequences of political violence, media and foreign policy, and authoritarian institutions. My scholarship bridges political phenomenon in East Asia (China and the two Koreas) to the broader comparative politics and international relations literature.

In 2021 January, I taught an undergraduate level course "Chinese Politics" at [Randolph-Macon College](https://www.rmc.edu/) as an adjunct assistant professor at the department of political science. Starting 2021 April, I am an analyst at [GeoQuant](https://geoquant.com/), which leverages political science concepts to measure political risk across 100+ countries.

I am also passionate about applying computational tools and data science, and have experience working as a data consultant for tech startups. For more details, please see [here](/data_analytics/).
