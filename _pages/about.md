I am a research fellow at the [Institute for Asian Studies](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/institutes/giga-institute-for-asian-studies/) at [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/) in Hamburg, Germany. I conduct research on topics of civil society and the state, consequences of political violence, media and foreign policy, and institutions that contributes to authoritarian resilience with regional focus on China and the two Koreas. Part of my dissertation which examines how NGO service outsourcing in China affects political legitimacy is forthcoming in *Chinese Political Science Review*. I hold MA and PhD in Political Science from [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu). 

I am concurrently a geopolitical risk analyst and consultant at [GeoQuant](https://geoquant.com/), which fuses artificial intelligence and political science to measure political risk across 100+ countries.
