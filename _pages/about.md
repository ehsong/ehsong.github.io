Welcome! I am an Associate Professor at the [Department of Government](https://www.uib.no/en/gov), [University of Bergen (UiB)](https://www.uib.no/en). A political scientist by training, my research focuses on politics of China and authoritarian governance, with a particular emphasis on stateâ€“society relations, civil society and NGO policy. More broadly, I study authoritarianism in East Asia (China and the Korean penninsular) and international affairs in the Asia-Pacific. I am also an associate at the [German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/) and a non-resident fellow at the [European Center for North Korean Studies](https://ecnk.univie.ac.at/) at University of Vienna. I am currently also a co-organizer of [GIGA China Series](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/events/conferences-and-workshops/giga-china-series).

My works are forthcoming or published in peer-reviewed journals and policy outlets including *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, *Australian Journal of International Affairs*, *Asian Survey*, *Journal of East Asian Studies*, *Democratization*, and *The Diplomat*, among others. My current [book project](https://esthersong.org/book/) focuses on explaining the paradox of NGO sector expansion in authoritarian China, showing how the state strategically fosters and controls civil society using mechanisms of outsourcing to enhance governance while mitigating political risks.

Before coming to UiB I was a research fellow at the at [GIGA](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/). I have also held fellowships and a visiting position at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in Shanghai, China. I hold MA and PhD in Political Science from [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu).
