*Naver News Crawler*


There has been rise in demand for scraping news online, yet there has not been a proper tool that allows scraping Korean news online. This tool allows users to scrape news published on Naver, one of the largest web portals in South Korea. Pre-existing tools only allow crawling a single query result that does not allow collection of new results over time. This tool allows collection of news published on Naver over a period of time, and also provides the user with the option to limit the scrape results per date. For instance, news results per day may reach more than 40,000 page results, but the user can limit the scope by setting the starting page and the ending page using command line options. To install the package please see [here](https://pypi.org/project/navernewscrawler/).
