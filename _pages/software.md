*Naver News Crawler*

A Python tool for scraping news results on Naver. To install the package please see [here](https://pypi.org/project/navernewscrawler/).

This tool allows users to scrape news published on Naver, one of the largest web portals in South Korea. The [Naver news site](https://news.naver.com) publishes articles from more than 40 news sources in South Korea. Pre-existing tools only allows crawling a single query result, and does not allow scraping news results over time. This tool allows collection of news published on Naver over a period of time, and also provides the user with the option to limit the scrape results per date.

*Twitter Handle Scraper*

Python script that collects handles of entities or names on twitter. I used this scraper to find handles of members of the 21st national assembly in South Korea. The script can be applied widely to find accounts of entities or persons. Please see the details [here](https://github.com/ehsong/twitter-handle-scraper).
